    Given a sequence of (time, head) data series, rediscretize to get
    an average crossing time of each integer multiple of head_step for
    each series.  Then find a time offset for each data series that
    minimizes the sum of squared differences in times when all data
    series cross those head values.  This offset *replaces* the existing
    offset of the series, t_new = t - min(t) + time_offset

    The series in the list with the largest initial head is treated as
    the reference series, and assigned a time offset of zero.
